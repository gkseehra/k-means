This repository has 1 python notebook that consist of 3 different implementation of k-means:
1. Lloyd k-means: This is the simplest form of k-means where centroids are initialized randomly. For subsequent calculation of centroids it takes the mean of the data assigned to a given centroid and that becomes the new centroid. The algorith runs till the average change in centroid values between two consecutive iterations becomes less than a threshold.
2. k-means with SSE as stopping criteria: In this algorithm, the algorithm runs till the change in sum of squared error (SSE) between the centroid and its data points for the current iteration and the previous iteration becomes less than a threshold value.
3. k-means++: In this algorithm the stopping criteria is same as the one in simple k-means but the way the centroids are initialized is different. Instead of randomly initializing centroids, a probability distribution is calculated for all the data points and then centroids are picked. The probability distribution is given by: D(x)^2 / Î£(D(x)^2) where D(x) is the euclidean distance between a given data point and the closest centroid (that has already been chosen).
